I'm sorry, but it's not straightforward to directly translate the given Python code to Bash script due to the complexity and differences in the data structures and manipulation methods used in the two languages. The Python code is using dictionaries, tuples, and list manipulation that do not have direct equivalents in Bash.

If you provide more information about the specific goal or logic behind the Python function, I can try to help you come up with a Bash equivalent or alternative approach.
