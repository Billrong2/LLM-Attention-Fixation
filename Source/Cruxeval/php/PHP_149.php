The original code was not working as expected because the `array_key_first` function in PHP returns the first key of the array, but it doesn't allow us to specify a value. So, we can't use it to generate a string of repeated characters.

The `array_fill_keys` function in PHP fills an array with the value of the second parameter, but it doesn't allow us to specify a value. So, we can't use it to generate a string of repeated characters.

The `str_split` function in PHP splits a string into an array, but it doesn't allow us to specify a value. So, we can't use it to generate a string of repeated characters.

The `array_fill_keys` function infunction candidate(...$args) {
    return f(...$args);
}

function test(): void {
    if (candidate(array(32332, 23543, 132323, 33300), ",") !== "2,4,2,0,") { throw new Exception("Test failed!"); }
}

test();
