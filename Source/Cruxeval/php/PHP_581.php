The original Python code and PHP code are not equivalent. The Python code inserts a character from the `sign` string at a specific position in the `text` string, while the PHP code tries to insert a character from the `sign` string at a specific position in the `new_text` array.

The Python code uses the `insert` method of the list, which inserts an element at a specific position in the list. The PHP code uses the `array_splice` function, which inserts an element at a specific position in the array.

The Python code uses the `join` method of the string, which concatenates all the elements of the list into a string. The PHP code uses the `implode` function, which concatenates all the elements of the array into a string.

The Python code uses the `len` function, which returns the number of elements in the list. The PHP code uses the `count` function, which returns the number of elements in the array.

The Python code uses the `range` function, which returns a sequence of numbers. The PHP code uses the `for` loop, which iterates over a sequence of numbers.

The Python code uses the `//` operator, which performs integer division. The PHP code uses the `(int)` function, which converts a value to an integer.

The Python code uses the `+` operator, which performs addition. The PHP code uses the `.` operator, which concatenates strings.

The Python code uses the `list` function, which converts a string to a list. The PHP code uses the `str_split` function, which converts a string to an array.

The Python code uses the `str` function, which converts a list to a string. The PHP code uses the `implode` function, which concatenates all the elements of the array into a string.

The Python code uses the `assert` statement, which raises an `AssertionError` if the condition is false. The PHP code uses the `throw new Exception` statement, which raises an `Exception` if the condition is true.

The Python code uses the `def` keyword, which defines a function. The PHP code uses the `function` keyword, which defines a function.

The Python code uses the `:` symbol, which separates the function parameters and the function body. The PHPfunction candidate(...$args) {
    return f(...$args);
}

function test(): void {
    if (candidate("akoon", "sXo") !== "akoXoosn") { throw new Exception("Test failed!"); }
}

test();
